        Introduction
        ============
        
        This PAS plugin will reject multiple logins with the same user at the same
        time. It ensures that only one browser may be logged with the same userid at
        one time.
        
        Implementation
        --------------
        
        The implementation works like this: Suppose that Anna and Karl are two people
        who share a login annaandkarl in our site. Anna logs in, authenticating for
        the first time. We generate a cookie with a unique id for Anna and remember
        the id ourselves. For every subsequent authentication (i.e. for every
        request), we will make sure that Anna's browser has the cookie.
        
        Now Karl decides to log in into the site with the same login annaandkarl, the
        one that Anna uses to surf the site right now. The plugin sees that Karl's
        browser doesn't have our cookie yet, so it generates one with a unique id for
        Karl's browser, remembers it and forgets about Anna's cookie.
        
        What happens when Anna clicks on a link on the site? The plugin sees that Anna
        has our cookie but that it differs from the cookie value that it remembered
        (Karl's browser has that cookie value). Anna is logged out but the plugin and
        sees the message "Someone else logged in under your name".
        
        .. Warning::
        
            Because this implementation stores its mappings in the ZODB on attributes
            of the plugin itself, there may be issues with scaling.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add ``Products.NoDuplicateLogin`` to the eggs parameter of your ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``
        section::
        
            [plone]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            eggs =
                Plone
                ...
                Products.NoDuplicateLogin
        
        Now run buildout and restart Plone. Once Plone has started, login and browse
        to ``Site Setup -> Zope Management Interface -> acl_users`` and add a ``No Duplicate
        Login Plugin`` from the drop down menu in the upper right.
        
        After that, click on the ``No Duplicate Login Plugin`` object in the acl_users
        folder listing. For both the ``Authentication`` and ``Reset Credentials``
        objects in the ``No Duplicate Login Plugin`` folder listing, click, then move the
        ``no_duplicate_login`` plugin from the ``Available Plugins`` display widget on the
        left to the ``Active Plugins`` display widget on the right using the arrow
        buttons in the middle.
        
        Now test! It may also be necessary to "arrow up" the ``no_duplicate_login``
        plugin in the ``Active Plugins`` display listing for both ``Authentication``
        and ``Reset Credentials``.
